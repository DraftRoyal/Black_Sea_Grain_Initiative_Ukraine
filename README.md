# Black_Sea_Grain_Initiative_Ukraine
Vessel inspection and downtime analysis

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February led to a complete halt of maritime grain shipments from Ukraine, previously a major exporter via the Black Sea. This resulted in a rise in world food prices and the threat of famine in lower-income countries. To address the issue, discussions began in April, hosted by Turkey (which controls the maritime routes from the Black Sea) and supported by the UN. The resulting agreement was signed in Istanbul on 22 July 2022, valid for a period of 120 days.

The July agreement created procedures to safely export grain from certain ports to attempt to address the 2022 food crisis. Joint Coordination and Inspection Center was set up in Turkey, with the UN serving as secretariat.
Russia suspended its participation in the agreement for several days due to a drone attack on Russian naval ships elsewhere in the Black Sea, but rejoined following mediation (for further infornation see at Wikipedia).
The Black Sea Grain Initiative was designed to free up Ukrainian wheat, barley and other food critical to nations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, where shortages of affordable supplies sent food prices surging and helped throw more people into poverty. (see VOA)
Russia is deliberately slowing down the grain agreement by extending the length of inspections for ships heading to and from its Black Sea ports.Politico
